Yo's you if it's raining.

Sign up by sending a yo to MadisonRainYo.  
It'll yo you whenever it starts raining in Madison.


Currently, this works as follows:

  `IFTTT: change in weather conditions --> tweet @gorainyo`<br>
  `Zapier: tweet @gorainyo --> POST request to RainYo app`<br>
  `RainYo: POST request from zapier --> Yo's subscribers`<br>


There's got to be a way to consolidate those steps, so that's my next task.
