Yo's you if it's raining.

Sign up by sending a yo to MadisonRainYo.  
It'll yo you whenever it starts raining in Madison.


Currently, this works as follows:

IFTTT: change in weather conditions --> tweet @gorainyo
Zapier: tweet @gorainyo --> POST request to RainYo app
RainYo: POST request from zapier --> Yo's subscribers


There's got to be a way to consolidate that, so that's my next step.
